## Abstract
This project focuses on the transformative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on energy systems. During the pandemic, the usual patterns of life - and consequently, energy consumption - have seen significant shifts. Our study aims to unravel how these shifts have impacted the transition to sustainable energy. We study the correlation between pandemic timelines and energy use, probe into the public's burgeoning awareness of green energy, and evaluate the structural changes in energy consumption. By narrating the story of this special period through the lens of energy, we seek to offer insights and strategies for a greener future.

## Research Questions
- First, with the progress of these time series (1st case, 1st death, School closure, Public events banned, Lockdown, Mobility, Normalcy), for some specific countries, as time progresses, the entire energy system ( Has the supply and demand for electricity, oil and natural gas changed? (This data is readily available), and how has the demand for different types of energy shifted? (For example, as people travel less and work from home, has demand for electricity increased? Has demand for fuel decreased?)
- Second, has peopleâ€™s awareness of green energy transition changed during the epidemic? Changes in interest can be found by looking at the number of views on pages related to the topic "green energy" (photovoltaics, wind power, hydropower, nuclear energy, electric vehicles, etc.).
- Third, we focus on whether the energy consumption structure of a specific country has changed before and after the epidemic. What suggestions do our findings have for renewable energy transition strategies?
