# Project Proposal: Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Energy System Transition

## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted various sectors globally, including the energy industry. This project aims to investigate the impact of the pandemic on energy system transition. By analyzing relevant datasets, we seek to understand how the pandemic has influenced the supply and demand for electricity, oil, and natural gas in specific countries. Additionally, we aim to explore changes in people's awareness of green energy and the shift in energy consumption patterns.

To address these research questions, we will utilize available datasets such as 'interventions.csv', which provides information about interventions implemented during the pandemic, and 'applemobilitytrends-2020-04-20.csv.gz' and 'Global_Mobility_Report.csv.gz', which offer mobility data that can be correlated with energy consumption. We will also analyze 'Finland_2019.csv' and similar files for other countries to examine changes in energy usage before and after the pandemic.

Our methodology might involve data analysis and visualization techniques. We will apply statistical analysis, time series analysis, and regression modeling to identify relationships between variables and uncover insights. The project timeline spans five weeks, encompassing data collection, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, and visualization.

By conducting this research, we aim to contribute to the understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on energy system transition. The findings can inform renewable energy strategies and facilitate a more sustainable and resilient energy future.

## Research Questions
1. How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect the supply and demand for electricity, oil, and natural gas in specific countries?
2. Has the demand for different types of energy shifted during the pandemic?
3. How has people's awareness of green energy transition changed during the epidemic?
4. What is the relationship between mobility and energy consumption in the selected countries?
5. How did the Wikipedia pageviews of "green energy" topics change during the pandemic?
6. Is the proportion of renewable resources increase during the pandemic?
## Proposed Additional Datasets
In addition to the primary datasets mentioned above, we will explore the following additional dataset to enrich our analysis:

‘Finland_2019.csv’(Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Serbia, Spain) (2019~2021): This dataset contains changes in the consumption of different energy sources(eg. biomass, nuclear, marine.) in these six countries from the beginning of January 2019 to the end of July 2021. With the help of this dataset, we can further explore...................................................................................................................

## Methods
Our project will employ a combination of data analysis, machine learning and visualization techniques to address the research questions. The methodology includes the following steps:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: We will acquire the relevant datasets, ensuring data quality and consistency. We will clean the data, handle missing values, and perform necessary transformations.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: We will conduct exploratory analysis to gain insights into the distributions, trends, and patterns in the data. This will involve descriptive statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.

3. Statistical Analysis: Use statistical techniques to examine the relationships between variables and assess the significance of observed trends. We will apply machine learning model to find the impact of the pandemic on energy consumption and demand and then do the evaluation and prediction.

4. Time Series Analysis: We will perform time series analysis to analyze the temporal patterns and seasonality in energy usage before and during the pandemic. This analysis will help understand the effects of various pandemic-related events on energy consumption.

5. Visualization and Interpretation: We will employ data visualization techniques to present our findings effectively. Clear and informative visualizations will aid in communicating the results and insights derived from the analysis.

## Proposed Timeline
The project will be executed over a five-week timeline:

- Week 1: Data collection and preprocessing. Acquire primary and additional datasets, clean the data, and perform necessary transformations.
- Week 2: Exploratory data analysis. Conduct descriptive statistics, visualize data distributions, and explore relationships between variables.
- Week 3: Statistical analysis. Apply regression analysis and other statistical techniques to analyze the impact of the pandemic on energy consumption and demand.
- Week 4: Time series analysis. Investigate temporal patterns and seasonality in energy usage before and during the pandemic.
- Week 5: Visualization and documentation. Create visualizations to present the findings and insights. Prepare the final project report and documentation.

## Organization within the Team
To ensure efficient progress and collaboration within the team, we propose the following internal milestones:

- Week 1: Data collection and preprocessing. Assign team members to gather and clean the primary and additional datasets.
- Week 2: Exploratory data analysis. Divide the team into subgroups to explore different aspects of the data and share insights.
- Week 3: Statistical analysis. Collaboratively conduct statistical analysis, combining expertise and sharing results within the team.
- Week 4: Time series analysis. Split theteam into smaller teams to analyze specific aspects of time series data and identify patterns and trends.
- Week 5: Visualization and documentation. Collaborate on creating visualizations and preparing the final project report. Review and provide feedback on the documentation.

By organizing the team in this manner, we can ensure efficient progress, effective collaboration, and timely completion of the project milestones.
